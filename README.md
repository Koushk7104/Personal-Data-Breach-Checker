# Personal-Data-Breach-Checker
The Personal Data Breach Checker is a user-friendly web or mobile application that helps individuals determine if their personal information—such as email addresses, phone numbers, or usernames—has been exposed in data breaches. It leverages external APIs like HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) or its own database to provide breach details and actionable security recommendations. The app aims to improve cybersecurity awareness and encourage best practices like strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA).
Core Features
1.	Quick Data Breach Check:
Users can input their email, phone number, or username to instantly check if their data has been exposed in known breaches.
2.	Breach Details:
Provides detailed information about the breach, including affected websites, types of exposed data (e.g., passwords, credit card info), and the date of the breach.
3.	Mitigation Recommendations:
Offers personalized security tips like changing compromised passwords, enabling 2FA, and monitoring for fraudulent activity.
4.	Notification System:
Allows users to subscribe for alerts via email or push notifications if their data appears in future breaches.
5.	Local Database Backup:
Ensures functionality even if external APIs are unavailable by maintaining its own database of breaches.
Future Enhancements
1.	Dark Web Monitoring:
Integrate features to scan the dark web for user data being sold or traded.
2.	AI-Powered Prediction:
Use AI to identify potential vulnerabilities and predict data leaks before they go public.
3.	Multi-Platform Support:
Expand compatibility for desktop apps alongside web and mobile versions.
4.	Password Strength Checker:
